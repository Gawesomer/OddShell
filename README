Implementation of a simple shell.

Characteristics:
    Supports pipes and STDOUT overwrite redirection.
    However, implements the above reading right to left.
    e.g
            osh$ out.txt < grep word | cat file.txt
        equivalent to
            bash$ cat file.txt | grep word > out.txt
    Particular liking for characters 'c', 'm', 'p' and 't' and duplicates these
    characters when they appear in the STDOUT output to the user.
    e.g.
        osh$ echo computer
        ccommpptter
